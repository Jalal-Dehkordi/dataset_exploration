# Titanic Survival Predictor Project

This educational project aims to provide hands-on experience in working with datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predicting the survival status of passengers on the Titanic. The project utilizes the well-known dataset "titanic_train.csv" from Kaggle as the data source. The primary objective is to guide you through the step-by-step process of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and creating a simple prediction model.

## Project Steps:

1. **Data Extraction and Dataset Familiarization:**
   - Download the "titanic_train.csv" dataset from the Kaggle source.
   - Get acquainted with the dataset's structure and explore its various features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Analysis:**
   - Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to perform exploratory data analysis.
   - Focus on the "Survived" feature and extract meaningful insights from the data.
   - Investigate the "Pclass" feature as one of the influential factors in survival prediction.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Manage missing values in the dataset after performing EDA. Features like "Age," "Cabin," and "Embarked" require handling of missing values.
   - Choose appropriate methods to handle missing values, such as using the mean for the "Age" feature and a suitable method (e.g., mode) for "Cabin" and "Embarked."

4. **Creating Prediction Model :**
  Creating a machine learning model that will be taught with the topic reported in the next repository.



## Note:
The project serves as an educational example and does not cover topics such as model optimization, parameter adjustment, and detailed model evaluation, which will be taught in the next repository along with the creation of a model.
